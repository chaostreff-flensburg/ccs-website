        It doesn't matter whether you come from the field of economics, politics, social science, technology or art - we want to learn about your relationship to the issues surrounding the topic of "information technology" and promote it as an added value for society. Because between buzzwords like "digital transformation", "big data", "efficiency", "innovation", ethical principles and issues also play a role in the modern world, in addition to data and applications.
