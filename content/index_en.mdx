        It doesn't matter whether you come from the field of economics, politics, social science, technology or art - we want to learn about your relationship to the issues surrounding the topic of "information technology" and promote it as an added value for society. Because between buzzwords like "digital transformation", "big data", "efficiency", "innovation", ethical principles and issues also play a role in the modern world, in addition to data and applications.

### Why are there only 4 scholarships?

We will start with the winter semester 2022/23. The entire project is a prototype for us to test what is possible and feasible with this method.

A master's thesis is a final paper of a master's degree program according to the requirements of the respective examination regulations.
Funding of diploma theses as final papers of a diploma course is also possible.

There is no time limit for applying for a scholarship for the winter semester 2022. Once all the funds have been awarded, there will be no more opportunities to apply. You can see how many scholarships have already been awarded under stats.
