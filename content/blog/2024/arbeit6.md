## Abstract

In a society where gender biases persist, technological advancements are not immune to perpetuating existing prejudices against women. While initial research was
able to show the potential of social robots to counter gender stereotypes, this study
seeks to investigate their role in addressing sexist remarks within group settings.
Using a mixed methods laboratory approach, the study examined how people react
when the social robot Pepper intervenes in sexist encounters. Participants (N =
68) engaged in a game scenario where a sexist comment was uttered, prompting
Pepper to intervene in one of three ways: 1. avoidant, 2. argumentative, or 3.
morally judgmental. Participants were assigned roles as either the target of the
comment or the bystander. Results revealed that exposure to sexist remarks elicited
negative emotions among participants. Participants who were the target of the
sexist comment rated the sexist confederate significantly worse than both the robot
and the bystander. This demonstrates that actively engaging in group conflicts and
intervening may enhance individuals’ perceptions of Pepper’s suitability as a team
member, potentially reaching human ratings.

Furthermore, the study found that an avoidant response from Pepper may not effectively address the sexist nature of the comment, while a confrontational approach
showed promise. There are tendencies that the morally judgmental response risks
escalating conflicts. Further research is necessary to verify these findings.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates the potential of social robots to intervene
in sexist encounters and prompt reflection on individual reactions. These findings
underscore the importance of exploring innovative approaches to interventions in
interpersonal interactions through morally competent robots
