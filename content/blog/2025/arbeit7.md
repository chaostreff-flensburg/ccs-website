## Abstract

This thesis explores the role of the European Union (EU) as a global actor in the domain
of cybersecurity and cyber capacity building (CCB). It integrates perspectives from international development, cyber governance, international cybersecurity, and the EU’s global actorness to analyse how the EU portrays cybersecurity, capacity building, and its role as
a global development actor. By utilising frame analysis, the study assesses the EU’s strategic global frameworks, cyber diplomacy, international cybersecurity and CCB documents.

The research highlights that the EU uses a multifaceted approach in its framing, intertwining external and internal security, normative values, growth, and geopolitical concerns. This signifies the importance the EU places on cybersecurity for both global and
European stability and prosperity. While the EU strongly advocates for a human-centric
digital transformation that is based on an idealist approach and fundamental rights, my
analysis shows that its initiatives are also influenced by strategic and geopolitical considerations. Eurocentric perspectives and (post)colonial imaginaries of power create this
dual narrative together with the EU’s goal to carve out a unique identity in a changing
world order through technology and cyberspace. My thesis critically examines the EU’s
endeavours to promote global cybersecurity development, revealing tensions between the
EU’s normative goals and its rising strategic interests, highlighting the influence of colonial power structures, and identifying risks of perpetuating global inequalities despite the EU’s emphasis on equal partnerships. The research contributes to the literature on international cybersecurity, international development, and EU external relations, providing
insights into the complexities of the EU’s position in the global digital arena.

Key words: cyber capacity building, EU as a global actor, cybersecurity, international
development, geopolitics, human-centric digital transformation.
