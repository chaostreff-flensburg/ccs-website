        The Chaotic Catalyst Fellowship is an independent, volunteer-run funding
        project from the community of the
        <a href="https://www.ccc.de/"> Chaos Computer Club (CCC)</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Founded and organized by the
        <a href="https://c3fl.de/"> Chaos Computer Club Flensburg</a> and
        <a href="https://chaotikum.org/"> Chaotikum</a>, it stands up for the core
        ideas of the CCC:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          Open knowledge, digital self-determination, transparency, solidarity,
          and a future that belongs to everyone.
        </strong>

  <h2 className={"title"}>Our mission: <br /><mark>Understand technology. Change society.</mark></h2>

  <div className={"display-row gap"}>
    <div className={"moreSpace"}>
      <p>
        We liberate knowledge because open research and transparency are the
        foundations of a just society. We build a community that does not judge
        technology solely by its technical capabilities, but questions it
        critically, holds it accountable, and shapes it responsibly.
      </p>

      <p>
        We connect people who stand for open ideals, not buzzwords. Together, we
        develop ideas that improve society, expose power structures, and bring
        technology back to where it belongs: in the service of people.

    <ul class="cool-list">
      <li class="noPoint">
        No tech buzzwords. No hype. We support substance, not marketing.
      </li>

      <li class="noPoint">
        Diversity of perspectives. Information technologies can and should not
        be viewed solely from a computer science perspective. Their benefits,
        consequences, and influence also manifest in politics, art,
        psychology, medicine, and ecology. We therefore support projects from
        all disciplines.
      </li>

      <li class="noPoint">
        Open by default. What we support should be freely accessible for
        research, activism, art, and the community.
      </li>

      <li class="noPoint">
        Independence. We work voluntarily, non-profit, and without institutional
        influence. Our decisions follow our values, not markets or stock prices.
      </li>

      <li class="noPoint">
        No elite or merit-based funding. We support people, not performance
        metrics. Those who engage socially, do care work, take detours, or face
        barriers must not be penalized for it.
