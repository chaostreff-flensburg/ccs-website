## Abstract

More and more activities take place online nowadays. Therefore, access
to online services is crucial to participate in modern society. People
with disabilities are frequently excluded from full digital
participation because digital devices and software do not consider
accessibility to a sufficient level [1, 2]. In order to give everyone
the same possibilities for digital participation, a rethinking is needed
in all areas of information technology. With regard to cybersecurity,
this means taking the accessibility of security systems more into
account. This can be done by providing accessible options for
accomplishing security-related tasks like authentication, but also by
broadening the view for threats and attack scenarios related to specific
characteristics and needs of marginalised groups [3, 4].
One of the most common cyber attacks is phishing [5, 6] ; a form of
social engineering attack which "electronically deceives a user to
conform to some action, subsequently, divulging sensitive information"
[7]. To offer all members of society the highest possible degree of
safety from phishing attacks, it is necessary to include the
perspectives of marginalised groups into defense strategies.

This thesis examines the experiences and challenges of people with
intellectual disabilities with phishing. Therefore interviews with
twelve participants with intellectual disabilities were conducted which
involved an e-mail assessment task with three example e-mails. The
interviews were analysed using content structuring qualitative content
analysis. The data shows that phishing attacks are a relevant issue for
people with intellectual disabilities and that experiences with phishing
attacks are common in this population. The results further display that
the capability to detect malicious e-mails varies strongly between
individuals. Also the awareness for risks and privacy issues differs
among the participants: some expressed awareness for possible risks
while others reported problematic behavior with
regard to e-mail attacks. The assessment strategies of the participants
mainly focused on the content of an e-mail instead of technical, more
reliable clues. The study identifies missing knowledge about attacks and
defense strategies as having a negative impact on the capability of
people with intellectual disabilities to detect phishing. Furthermore,
difficulties with reading and understanding text are found to be
impeding in this context. Get support from others, mainly family and
professional caregivers, is determined as a prominent strategy of people
with intellectual disabilities to assess and handle suspicious e-mails.
Concerns because of the immanent privacy issues of this strategy were
not brought up by any of the participants. The results of this study
indicate that educational interventions using easy-to-read language and
text-alternatives are a promising approach to support people with
intellectual disabilities in detecting malicious e-mails. The role of
caregivers and relatives of people with intellectual disabilities should
also be considered in such interventions.
